In September 1974, the American science-fiction writer Philipp K. Dick, wrote a letter to the FBI,
claiming that there was a communist conspiracy disguised as science-fiction literature. This
conspiracy was orchestrated by a communist committee, which — according to Philipp K. Dick —
operated under the name of “Stanislaw Lem”.<br/>
While of course he was neither a committee, nor a conspiracy; Stanislaw Lem was a writer that produced a body of work so vast and so far-reaching, that it is easy to understand Philipp K. Dick’s refusal to accept that it was the work of only one person.<br/><br/>
Summa Technologiae School is organized in cooperation between e-flux and Adam Mickeiwicz Institute and curated by Julieta Aranda.
